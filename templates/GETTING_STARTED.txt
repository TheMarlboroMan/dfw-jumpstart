Setup was succesful!.

Before compiling you must have built all previous dependencies as stated in the original project's README.md file.

Once the dependencies are ready you will be able to compile and try the project with make -f makefile_linux|win all. The flags of the compiler will be set to enable debugging.

If you haven't do so yet, please, build the libdansdl2, dfw, log and tools documentation with doxygen!.

You can find a controller template in the class/controllers/_template.* file and many wonderful examples in the original project.

If you want to, you can do "./scripts/create_controller controller_name" to automatically create a controller and add it to the dependency list. This will also add the controller to the states.h file and the state_driver.* files through the magic of sed and awk :D.

Remember, the project will compile (with warnings) but not run until you add a controller!. Once the controller is added, you will want to set it up as the starting controller in class/dfwimpl/state_driver.cpp's constructor.

Happy hacking :).
