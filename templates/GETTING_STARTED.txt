Setup was succesful!.

Before compiling you must have built all previous dependencies as stated in the original project's README.md file.

Once the dependencies are ready you will be able to compile and try the project with make -f makefile_linux|win all. The flags of the compiler will be set to enable debugging.



Happy hacking :).
