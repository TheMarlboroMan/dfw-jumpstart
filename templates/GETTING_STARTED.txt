Setup was succesful!.

Before compiling you must have built all previous dependencies as stated in the original project's README.md file.

Once the dependencies are ready you will be able to compile and try the project with make -f makefile_linux|win all. The flags of the compiler will be set to enable debugging.

A good starting point would be to replace the example controller with your own (remove it from the class/controllers directory, the class/controllers/states.h file, the make/controllers file and the class/dfwimpl/state_driver.* implementation).

Happy hacking :).
